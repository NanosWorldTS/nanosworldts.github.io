# Introduction

NanosWorldTS allows you to write [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for the game [NanosWorld](https://nanos.world/).

You can write Client, Server and Shared files in Typescript and also use Lua packages by  using NanosWorldTS because your code gets compiled to Lua thanks to [TSTL](https://typescripttolua.github.io/)

# Why is it awesome ?
